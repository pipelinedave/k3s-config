# Global Copilot Instructions

## Todo Management
- Always check for the file `.github/todo/Todo.md` in this repository.
- Process the todo list based on the instructions in `.github/todo/CopilotTodo.md`.
- Maintain the structure of the todo list while allowing me to freely add new items anywhere.
- Help me prioritize and work on tasks from the todo list.

## Markdown Linting
- Always ensure all Markdown files follow consistent linting rules:
  - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
  - Include blank lines around headings, code blocks, and lists
  - Indent nested list items properly
  - Use backticks for inline code and proper fenced code blocks with language specifiers
  - No bare URLs (use proper link syntax)
  - Include a single newline at the end of files
  - Include proper spacing in lists
  - Validate that ordered lists have proper sequential numbers
- When editing documentation, verify markdown lint compliance before committing
